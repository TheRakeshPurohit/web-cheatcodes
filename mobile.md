# See the document in a mobile view

Often the mobile version of a web site is much simpler and has fewer annoying popups, redirects and advertising. Some web sites also only allow content uploads from mobile apps. That's why you can use the browser device emulation to trick the site into thinking that you are using a mobile device.

1. [Open Developer Tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium/overview#open-devtools)
1. Click the [device emulation](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium/device-mode/) button
1. Select from a different emulated device

You can try this out and see the difference in [this mobile version demo page](https://codepo8.github.io/web-cheatcodes/mobile-version.html). Where it is a multi step process to see (or download) an image in the normal version of the site, the mobile version simply shows all of them in a larger size.

Often the mobile version of the site also has simpler video players. You can then right-click videos and select "save video as" or "show controls" to navigate the video.

Another interesting feature of this mode is that you can [spoof a different geographical location](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium/device-mode/#override-geolocation) but most sites will not fall for that and show you content specific to this locale. For that you'd need a VPN.
