# Check the document in different modes - print, dark and light

Operating systems have ways to allow users to customise the experience to their needs. You can choose a dark or a light mode, some users even need a high contrast mode to find their way around and others need to have animations turned off. While it is great that you cn do that on a computer level, sometimes you find that the experience offered by a web product in a certain mode isn't what you want. Instead of having to change your operating system settings, you can simulate these environmental changes using developers tools. Another mode that most web sites should have is a print mode. This one is often much simpler than the full design and thus might be easier to consume.

You can use the Rendering tool of browser developer tools to simulate these different modes. If - for example - the dark mode of a web site is too dark to your liking, you can switch it to light.

You can also see the print version of any web site without printing it.

And you can switch to reduced motion for sites that have too much animation going on.
