# Take screenshots of web content

Operating systems and browsers come with built-in tools to take screenshots. Often it is tricky though to only take a picture of what you want as there is a lot on the screen you don't want. And only selecting a certain part of a document can be tricky, too.

Take the [screenshot demo page](https://codepo8.github.io/web-cheatcodes/demos/screenshot.html) for example. I added a fake ad, useless "more" links and the bit you really want (the dog, of course) you need to scroll to.

Microsoft Edge comes with a built-in screenshot tool called Web Capture. You can enable it by hitting `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `S` on your keyboard (on Mac it is `Cmd` instead of `Ctrl`). This allows you to select the part of the screen you want to copy as an image.

You can also choose to take a picture of the whole document, which automatically scrolls all the way down for you and returns a picture to save or edit.

The first option could be tough to get right with elements that don't have much whitespace around them and the second option means you need to cut out what you need with another tool.
