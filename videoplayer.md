# Get a simpler video player

The Network tool shows you all the network traffic on the site. You can filter the network traffic by type, for example images and media, and click any of the entries to see a preview. You can either right-click the name to open it in a new tab, or right-click the preview to save or copy images. 

This is especially useful with videos that are loaded in annoying players. You can right-click the video name (normally ending in "mp4") and open it in a new tab. This will then feature a full video player that allows you to control and save the video.
